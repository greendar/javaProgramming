Good Morning Teachers!

With the school year coming to an end, itâ€™s time for the year end competition to culminate your classpack experience! Originally we were going to plan an in-person Provincial Championship but due to the supply chain issues that impacted how long your classes have had the equipment for we are opting to do a virtual competition instead. By now, you have heard of our programing simulator, FTC SIM, which some of you have used to introduce your students to programming. This is the platform we will be using for the competition. We built a whole new multiplayer mode and your teams will be the first to experience it!

It's called: FTC GOLF! The objective of the game is to get the robot to the flag in the least amount of runs (pressing go) and before your opponents! Don't think you can take your time figuring it out because you only have 5 minutes to get to the flag!
